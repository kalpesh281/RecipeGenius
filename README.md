RecipeGenius
[Project Description]:

This repository houses the codebase for a Recipe Generator, a machine learning-based project that takes an image of ingredients as input and generates recipes using those ingredients. The project uses React.js for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend. The machine learning model was trained using Jupyter Notebook, among other technologies.
